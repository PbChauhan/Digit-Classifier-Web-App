Model.h5 contains weights of a keras model trained on 46,000 of handwritten dataset of MNIST.
You can train your own model and replace the Model.json with your model info and Model.h5 with your saved model weights.
You can resize the training set according to your comfort. I have trained the model on 112 X 112 pixels of input size.
You can also use any pre-trained keras model.
My Model.py is present in static folder.
