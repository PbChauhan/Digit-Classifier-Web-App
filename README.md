Model.h5 contains weights of a keras model trained on 46,000 of handwritten dataset of MNIST.
You can train your own model and replace the Model.json with your model info and Model.h5 with your saved model weights.
You can resize the training set according to your comfort. I have trained the model on 28 X 28 pixels of input size.
I didn't use transfer-learning as it requires very basic model to train this dataset with a accuracy of 99% on validation set.
Some results are -
